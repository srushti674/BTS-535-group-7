Question 1: Problem Description


Finding skilled tradespeople such as electricians, plumbers, and other contractors can be a cumbersome and 
time-consuming process for homeowners and businesses. Many rely on word-of-mouth recommendations or 
third-party review sites, which may not always provide reliable or localized results. Tradespeople, on the other hand, 
often struggle to find consistent work or connect with clients outside of their established network. 
This disconnect between supply and demand creates inefficiencies in the market, leading to delays, inflated costs, 
or mismatched expectations.
