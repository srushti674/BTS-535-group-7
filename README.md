## Problem 1: Lack of centralized app to connect tradespeople and customers



## Problem 2: Monopolies → people just want to call big companies because they don’t know how/where to look for specific tradespeople 

A significant problem for a website focussed on connecting customers to trade services is the dominance of large companies that have monopolized the market. Many individuals tend to rely on big-name companies because they are unsure how or where to find specific tradespeople. While a platform that connects skilled workers across various trades offers flexibility in location and job type, it faces limitations in scalability and resources compared to larger companies. Large companies are often able to offer quick or same-day service due to their vast employee base, which smaller or independent companies cannot easily match. Furthermore, smaller companies may struggle with trust issues and lack of reviews, as customers may feel more secure using a well-known company. However, partnerships with real estate firms, large-scale properties, or organizations that support differently abled demographics (e.g. long term care homes) could provide steady opportunities for skilled workers. Despite the challenges of standing out in a market saturated with big competitors, a platform that includes features like location services, filtering and searching can help smaller, local tradespeople gain visibility and compete by matching customers with local handymen and apprentices.

## Problem 3: Unreliable contractors/Unclear billing of services/scams/Lack of trust/reliability of services e.g. inflated or fake reviews 

One big issue when hiring tradespeople, like electricians or plumbers, is trust. Some contractors may be unreliable, unclear about their prices, or even scammers. Customers often don't know if the reviews they see are real or if the price they are quoted will change later. This lack of trust makes it hard for people to feel confident when hiring someone for their projects.

### Proposed Solution

To fix these problems, the platform will make sure all contractors are verified by checking their credentials and reviews. We will create a simple, clear billing system where customers know exactly what they’re paying before the work starts. The platform will also monitor reviews to ensure they are real and not fake. In case of any disputes, we will have a system to help customers and contractors resolve issues. This way, both customers and tradespeople can trust the platform and each other.

### Technologies Required

- **Payment System**: Secure transactions will be handled through Stripe or PayPal.
- **Verification**: A service will be used to verify the identity and qualifications of tradespeople.
- **Database**: MySQL or PostgreSQL will be used to store user data, job details, and reviews.
- **Cloud Hosting**: The platform will be hosted on AWS to ensure reliability and security.
