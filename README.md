## Problem 1: Lack of centralized app to connect tradespeople and customers



## Problem 2: Monopolies → people just want to call big companies because they don’t know how/where to look for specific tradespeople 

A significant problem for a website focussed on connecting customers to trade services is the dominance of large companies that have monopolized the market. Many individuals tend to rely on big-name companies because they are unsure how or where to find specific tradespeople. While a platform that connects skilled workers across various trades offers flexibility in location and job type, it faces limitations in scalability and resources compared to larger companies. Large companies are often able to offer quick or same-day service due to their vast employee base, which smaller or independent companies cannot easily match. Furthermore, smaller companies may struggle with trust issues and lack of reviews, as customers may feel more secure using a well-known company. However, partnerships with real estate firms, large-scale properties, or organizations that support differently abled demographics (e.g. long term care homes) could provide steady opportunities for skilled workers. Despite the challenges of standing out in a market saturated with big competitors, a platform that includes features like location services, filtering and searching can help smaller, local tradespeople gain visibility and compete by matching customers with local handymen and apprentices.

## Problem 4: Onboarding and Training of Tradespeople/Expansion

One challenge a tradesperson service might encounter is difficulty in scaling its operations. Expanding into new locations or trades requires finding and onboarding tradespeople who are familiar with local markets and practices. Small businesses/apps may not have the resources to handle the logistical issues of training, supporting, and managing operations in multiple areas as it can stretch resources thin, leading to operational inefficiencies. One solution is to collaborate with local trade schools and offer apprenticeships to students. This improves reputation within the communities and locations one seeks to break into and also ensures a steady stream of young candidates. Additionally, partnering with local tradespeople who already have an established presence in the market can help them get more business, while helping the app further expand. However, limited resources for scaling may hinder the ability to support rapid onboarding and training in new areas and a lack of standardization across different regions and trades could result in inconsistent service quality. Within this weakness lies an opportunity to introduce localized training programs or apprenticeships that can help develop skilled tradespeople while improving brand recognition. One threat that could appear is competitors with larger networks or more resources could expand more quickly and capture target markets. The solution is the creation of a streamlined onboarding system within the app to onboard and train new tradespeople. This system could include interactive training modules to guarantee tradespeople are well-versed in the app's features and service standards. Additionally, incorporating a partner portal would facilitate the onboarding of established local tradespeople, allowing for quick integration into the platform. Technologies like a learning management system (LMS) for training and automated documentation tools would provide the necessary infrastructure to support onboarding and ensure a smooth expansion process.
