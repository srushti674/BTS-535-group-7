Question 1: Problem Description

2.
A significant problem for a website focussed on connecting customers to trade services is the dominance of large companies that have monopolized the market. Many individuals tend to rely on big-name companies because they are unsure how or where to find specific tradespeople. While a platform that connects skilled workers across various trades offers flexibility in location and job type, it faces limitations in scalability and resources compared to larger companies. Large companies are often able to offer quick or same-day service due to their vast employee base, which smaller or independent companies cannot easily match. Furthermore, smaller companies may struggle with trust issues and lack of reviews, as customers may feel more secure using a well-known company. However, partnerships with real estate firms, large-scale properties, or organizations that support differently abled demographics (e.g. long term care homes) could provide steady opportunities for skilled workers. Despite the challenges of standing out in a market saturated with big competitors, a platform that includes features like location services, filtering and searching can help smaller, local tradespeople gain visibility and compete by matching customers with local handymen and apprentices.
