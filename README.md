## Problem 3: Unreliable contractors/Unclear billing of services/scams/Lack of trust/reliability of services e.g. inflated or fake reviews 
Here's the content formatted in `.md` (Markdown) style for your README file:

One big issue when hiring tradespeople, like electricians or plumbers, is trust. Some contractors may be unreliable, unclear about their prices, or even scammers. Customers often don't know if the reviews they see are real or if the price they are quoted will change later. This lack of trust makes it hard for people to feel confident when hiring someone for their projects.

### Proposed Solution

To fix these problems, the platform will make sure all contractors are verified by checking their credentials and reviews. We will create a simple, clear billing system where customers know exactly what theyâ€™re paying before the work starts. The platform will also monitor reviews to ensure they are real and not fake. In case of any disputes, we will have a system to help customers and contractors resolve issues. This way, both customers and tradespeople can trust the platform and each other.

### Technologies Required

- **Payment System**: Secure transactions will be handled through Stripe or PayPal.
- **Verification**: A service will be used to verify the identity and qualifications of tradespeople.
- **Database**: MySQL or PostgreSQL will be used to store user data, job details, and reviews.
- **Cloud Hosting**: The platform will be hosted on AWS to ensure reliability and security.
